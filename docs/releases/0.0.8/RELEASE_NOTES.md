NoteCraft 0.0.8 is an alpha release focused on making image-heavy and right-to-left notes more reliable, while improving the release and installation path.

## Highlights

- Image resize handles are visible, functional, and persistent.
- Images can be selected and navigated with the caret and keyboard.
- `Ctrl+V` pastes images directly into a page.
- Arabic, Hebrew, Persian, and Urdu text receive improved caret, selection, and navigation behavior.
- Attachments are selected with a single click and opened with a double click.
- Windows and Linux packages include the generated HTML and CMGFM demo notebook, which identifies itself as version 0.0.8.
- CI now provides clearer quality gates and stronger release checks.

## Installation notes

This is an alpha release. Keep backups of notebooks that matter to you. Windows packages may be unsigned and can trigger a SmartScreen warning. Linux packages should be tested on the target distribution; WSL is useful for building and smoke tests but does not reproduce every distribution package-manager transaction.

## Known limitations

- macOS packaging scripts are prepared, but final Apple builds, signing, and notarization require macOS tooling.
- Performance profiling and dashboard work is deferred to a later release.
- Some lower-priority layout and first-launch issues remain documented in the 0.0.8 release folder.

## Upgrade note

NoteCraft stores notebooks as ordinary folders. Installing 0.0.8 does not remove notebook data, but keeping a backup before an alpha upgrade is recommended.

## Verification

The release candidate must pass `cargo xtask ci`. Packaging verification must confirm that the Windows and Linux artifacts contain both demo formats and that the packaged application reports version 0.0.8.
